SendGrid with ColdFusion via the Java API

Began exploring the Java API, but found it lacking, so it didn't make sense to continue to use it as the basis for a ColdFusion API wrapper.

Interacting directly with the API via ColdFusion would result in a more elegant and intuitive wrapper.

Wanted to keep the code around, however, in case it came in handy with some other project.
